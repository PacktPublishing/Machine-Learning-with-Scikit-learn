## About the Video Course
Machine learning is the buzzword bringing computer science and statistics together to build smart and efficient models. Using powerful algorithms and techniques offered by machine learning, you can automate any analytical model. This course examines a variety of machine learning models including popular machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, naive Bayes, k-means, decision trees, and artificial neural networks. It also discusses data preprocessing, hyperparameter optimization, and ensemble methods. You will build systems that classify documents, recognize images, detect ads, and more. You’ll learn to use scikit-learn’s API to extract features from categorical variables, text and images; evaluate model performance; and develop an intuition for how to improve your model’s performance. By the end of this course, you will master all required concepts of scikit-learn to build efficient models at work to carry out advanced tasks with the practical approach.
